# 🛰️ Classification of Space Objects Using Machine Learning

Welcome to my data science project where I explore the classification of space objects using supervised machine learning techniques. 🚀✨ This project aims to distinguish between different types of celestial bodies based on their physical and observational data.

## 📌 Project Overview

As space research advances, accurate classification of space objects—such as stars, planets, and galaxies—has become crucial for astrophysics and satellite tracking. This project leverages machine learning models to automate and improve this process using real-world data.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Explore and visualize space object data
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Apply classification algorithms
- Evaluate model performance
- Draw insights that could aid astronomers and researchers

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- CSV data (custom dataset)
- Machine Learning: Decision Trees, SVM, KNN

## 📁 Project Structure


## 📊 Results Snapshot

After testing multiple classifiers, the best performing model achieved **X% accuracy** (you can fill this in based on your actual results).

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to apply and evaluate multiple ML models
- Challenges in working with scientific datasets
- Importance of feature selection and preprocessing

## 🚀 Try It Yourself
